imageAlt: A cursor with an inversion mix filter. This inverts the shapes
  underneath it. It also responds in size to movements made by the user,
  magnifying the effect.

Code to customise the cursor shape for a webpage. This effect could enhance the users experience. By changing the semiotic "mouse" cursor that the audience expects it could be interesting to see what other signals could be used. Potentially using shapes, signs or text could help reiterate the function of the website.

```
var $cursor = $('.cursor');

function moveCursor(e) {
  $cursor.addClass('is-moving');
  $cursor.css({"top": e.pageY, "left": e.pageX});

  clearTimeout(timer2);

   var timer2 = setTimeout(function() {
       $cursor.removeClass('is-moving');
   }, 300);
}

$(window).on('mousemove', moveCursor);

```
