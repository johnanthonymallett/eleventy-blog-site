# Visiting Te Papa, Toi Art

I visited some exhibitions currently on display at Te Papa. These two works stood out to me as being interactive, and using digital and analogue interventions to create a deeper connection with the work. The curated works create an atmosphere that is engaging for the audience.

# Tiffany Singh: Indra’s bow & Total internal reflection

This work is really atmospheric and gives the user a choice to screen a colour of their choice depending on their mood, which displays for 30 seconds before creating a full colour display. This full colour spectrum of light overlaps and creates white spaces in the room.

<b>The lights arranged along the ceiling of the exhibit, connected to a button interface on the outside of the room.</b>

# Lisa Reihana: in Pursuit of Venus \[infected]

This work is takes reference from a wallpaper that was designed to exoticize the first meeting between colonial explorers and indigenous communities in the Pacific. Reihanas work digitises this wallpaper design to create a different narrative around this history and make it more interactive for the audience.

<b>200 years later in Aotearoa, Lisa Reihana employs 21st century digital technologies to bring the scenic wallpaper to life and challenge its Eurocentric narrative.</b>
