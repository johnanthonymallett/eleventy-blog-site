I was looking at some early graphic designers work. Some of the logos that were developed for print in large corporations often pursued a modern aesthetic that is recognisable and contrasts against the rest of the market. Adrian Frutigers 1970 'tnr' logo stood out to me. It has a playful and humanist aspects which contrast against the geometric counter punches which are a uniform circle, masking the main shapes.

<b>Frutigers other logos of the time. Limitations of print can only hint towards movement or dynamism.</b>

I had an urge to see how this would work as a variable design, giving more dynamic appearances and functions to the original meaning. Although this function may be somewhat useless, it does give a more activated meaning to the logo. My rendition may just be a playful experiment but there is potential for this technology to add many other meanings or functions to static text.
