        <h1>Images and Screens</h1>
<p>The inbetween space of analogue and digital can be seen as a blurry space. Most visual communication through contemporary design has some form of digital intervention. By analysing the distinctions between analogue and digital image production, it is clear that there is contrast, but both have similarities and relationships. I have chosen to dissect an image to make this relationship clear.</p>
<p>I started by screening each colour out of an existing digital image. This left me with 3 channels of colour: Red, Green &amp; Blue (RGB), commonly used in digital displays. By intersecting these images they represent the original image, with the traces of the pattern used for screening. Traditionally print uses a different array of colours to achieve a full image: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow. The addition and subtraction of these different colours is a direct relationship between them.</p>
<h1>Risography</h1>

<b>LEFT: A print using the colour yellow. RIGHT: Addition of magenta to yellow.</b></p>
<p>To execute this experiment and bring the digitally tampered images into an analogue context, I had to employ the additive and subtractive nature of colours into consideration. I employed the Risograph Printer, because of its economic attitude the risograph has a lighter and wetter ink that seems to automatically blend and sublimate colours into one another. Because my screens were separate, parts of the channels that intersect were already determined to merge into new colours by the addition or absence of each colour.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/untitled-1artboard-1_3.png" alt="LEFT: Cyan (Teal) print. RIGHT: Addition of cyan to yellow, because blue and yellow combined make green, it is possible to see small hints of a greener tone, something that was present in the original image." title="Risographic Prints">

<p>By weaving together each individual colour, it gives a really interesting analogue effect that cannot be easily replicated on a screen, but becomes more visually interesting because of its digital intervention from the beginning. The final full spectrum of colour gave a weaved, tartan look. This is most likely because of the subtractive nature of RGB. The origin of our screens goes back to a Scottish inventor and colour theorist named <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3666">James Clerk Maxwell.</a> His 1861 demonstration of the first colour photograph used images taken with separate red, green and blue lens filters, of a tartan scarf. The exposures were far from perfect but his hope was that colour images could be better represented.</p>
